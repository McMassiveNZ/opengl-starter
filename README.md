An opengl-starter cpp project which can open a simple window, create an OpenGL rendering context and render a quad to the screen. Its all done from scratch without using any 3rd party libraries like GLFW or GLEW. The project contains boilerplate for CMake, testing and basic CI. Static Analysis, Unit Tests and Sanitizers are off by default
